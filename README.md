# First Assignment of the Research Track 2 course - Sphinx branch

In this branch we can find the same files of the branch action, but with the comments for the documentation in Sphinx. The documentation is available inside the folder **_build** in the file **index.html**.

## Jupyter Notebook file: user_interface

In the folder Notebooks is present the file: **user_interface.ipynb**, that is a new node, with respect to the action branch, that implements a new user_interface more complete and enjoyable with respect to the previous one.
In the file itself is available the full documentation of this new node.
